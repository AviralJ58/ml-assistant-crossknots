# ML Assistant (Crossknots 2022)

ML Assistant allows you to train a machine learning model and deploy it without writing a single line of code. It provides the output code and and the API which can can be deployed or integrated with any website.

  

## Terms to know:

  

- Dataset: Dataset is a collection of data. For Machine Learning we use a tabular dataset. The dataset contains attributes (columns) which define the features for a certain dataset.

  

- Target Variable: Target Variable is the the feature of the dataset which whose values you need to predict. Depending on the target variable a Machine Learning algorithm can be a Classification model or Regression model.

  

- Classification: Classification model or function is used to predict values which are discrete in nature. In classification, data is categorized under different labels according to some parameters given in input and then the labels are predicted for the data. For example: Predicting which class of flowers a particular flower belongs to, yes/no or true/false questions like if a patient is diabetic or not etc.

  

- Regression: Regression model or function is used to predict continuous real values. The target outcome for regression model will always be a quantity. For example: Price of house, temperature of a city over certain period of time etc.

  

- Categorical Data: Categorical Data includes the text columns. In Python these columns have the type 'Object' and must be encoded to some numerical value for the algorithm to work.
